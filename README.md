## Index Fungorum

The [Index Fungorum](http://www.indexfungorum.org) contains names of fungi (including yeasts, lichens, chromistan fungal analogues, protozoan fungal analogues and fossil forms) at all ranks.


Each name in Index Fungorum has a Life Science Identifier (LSID) which has an associated set of metadata in RDF/XML. This repository takes the XML for each Index Fungorum name and reformats it as N-triples, correcting any minor format issues as part of that process. The resulting N-triples are intended to be uploaded into a triple store.
